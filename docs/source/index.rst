Welcome to Tilux' documentation!
================================

What is Tilux?
--------------

Tilux is a CLI with a bunch of scripts included that are useful and concise.

This is still very much a work in progress.

If you want to see a certain script added, open up a new `issue`_ or make a pull request.

.. _issue: https://github.com/endormi/tilux/issues/new/choose

*Feel free to try on other distros. PR's for supporting different distros are very much appreciated.*

**Note**: Only tested on Debian-based distros.

If you don't want to install the whole tool. You can download specific scripts, to know how check the contents underneath.

*Big part of the reason why I created this project is to learn, that's why I have used different programming languages when I could've just used one.*
