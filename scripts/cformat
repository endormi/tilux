  Quick hack to check if script is ran inside
  scripts folder and if it is CD out of the folder.

  cformat script is meant to be ran inside tilux folder, not outside
  so this should not cause any errors.

  I did not create and include a function, because in order to
  source the file, same check would have been needed.
