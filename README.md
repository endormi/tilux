## What is Tilux?

Tilux is a CLI with a bunch of scripts included that are useful and concise.

This is still very much a work in progress.

If you want to see a certain script added, open up a new [issue](https://github.com/endormi/tilux/issues/new/choose) or make a pull request.

## Why?

I as also many others (probably) as well have a ton of useful scripts for Linux, that just happen to be all over
the system and not in one specific folder. So this is where this project comes handy, everything is in one CLI,.

Also, a big part of the reason why I created this project is to learn, that's why I have used different programming languages when I could've just used one.

#### Usage:

```
git clone https://github.com/endormi/tilux.git
```

**Run** `usage`:

```bash
bash usage
```

> After running `usage` for the first time, you can use `tilux` instead of `usage`.

#### Install requirements:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt && bundle install
```

**Run** `tilux`:

```bash
./tilux
```

**Run** `tilux` using arguments:
> for example (exactly the same choices as running interactively)

```bash
./tilux monitoring -c
```

`--help`:

```bash
./tilux --help
```
