Welcome to Tilux' documentation!
================================

What is Tilux?
--------------

Tilux is a command-line interface (CLI) tool that provides a collection of useful and concise scripts.

If you want to see a certain script added, open up a new `issue`_ or make a pull request.

.. _issue: https://github.com/endormi/tilux/issues/new/choose

The project has been manually tested and verified only on Debian-based distributions.

*Feel free to try Tilux on other Linux distributions.
Pull requests for adding support for different distros are highly appreciated.*

If you prefer not to install the entire tool, you can download individual scripts.
For instructions on how to do this, please refer to the contents underneath.

*I created this project with the intention of learning, which is why
I have utilized multiple programming languages instead of just one.*
